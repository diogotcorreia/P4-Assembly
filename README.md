# About

VS Code addon providing language support for the P3 Assembly programming language, the language used in the fictitious [P3 processor](http://algos.inesc-id.pt/arq-comp/?Material_Did%C3%A1tico___Processador_P3), created at IST (Instituto Superior Técnico) for educational purposes.

## Features

So far only syntax highlighting is implemented. Recognizes all of P3's instruction mnemonics, labels and addressing modes.

## Credits

+ The logo design was created by *António Luciano*.
+ The #constants and labels definitions for the syntax were taken [from this extension](https://github.com/13xforever/x86_64-assembly-vscode).
